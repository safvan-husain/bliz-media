Project Overview

Berton Golden is a premium fragrance brand showcase website developed as a dedicated one-page platform to present the brand’s signature perfume collection.

Unlike the main Berton Perfumes eCommerce platform, this website was intentionally built as a static brand presentation site under a separate domain. The client required two independent digital identities — one focused on online selling and the other focused purely on brand positioning and product showcase.

The objective of this project was to create a visually immersive, elegant, and high-end landing experience that communicates sophistication and luxury.

Brand Strategy & Dual Website Approach

The client requested two separate websites under two domains:
	•	Berton Perfumes — eCommerce platform
	•	Berton Golden — premium brand showcase

This separation allows:
	•	Distinct brand positioning
	•	Independent marketing campaigns
	•	Different audience targeting
	•	Focused storytelling for the Golden line
	•	Clean and distraction-free product presentation

The Berton Golden site functions as a digital luxury brochure.
