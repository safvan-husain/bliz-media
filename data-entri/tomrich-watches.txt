TOMRICH WATCHES

Industry: Watch Manufacturing & Retail
Project Type: Small-Scale eCommerce Website (Future-Ready Architecture)

⸻

Project Overview

TOMRICH is a direct-to-consumer watch brand website developed for a growing business that designs and sells its own manufactured watches.

The objective of this project was to create a premium-looking, product-focused online store that reflects the craftsmanship and identity of the brand while keeping the system lightweight and cost-efficient.

Currently, the purchase flow redirects customers to WhatsApp for order confirmation. However, the platform is architected to support full payment gateway integration in future phases without structural redevelopment.

This strategy allows the brand to operate efficiently during its early growth stage while remaining technically scalable.

	•	Structured product detail pages
	•	Clear pricing display
	•	Strong call-to-action buttons
	•	Simple and refined typography

The interface is designed to communicate quality, precision, and premium aesthetics while keeping navigation simple and intuitive.

The layout ensures customers can:
	•	Explore available watch models
	•	View detailed product information
	•	Understand pricing clearly
	•	Initiate purchase quickly

Performance & Optimization

Performance was optimized to ensure smooth browsing and product viewing.

The website includes:
	•	Fast page load times
	•	Optimized product images

Tech Stack & Development Architecture

The website was developed using modern full-stack technologies with scalability in mind.

Technology Stack:
	•	Frontend: Next.js (React Framework)
	•	Backend: Node.js architecture
	•	Rendering Strategy: Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for SEO optimization
	•	Styling: Component-based responsive CSS
	•	Hosting: Cloud hosting (Firebase environment)

Using Next.js provides:
	•	SEO-friendly structure
	•	Fast page rendering
	•	Modular and scalable codebase
	•	Structured routing system
	•	Easy integration for future automation

The system is intentionally built to allow seamless transition into a fully automated eCommerce platform when required.

Current Purchase Flow (WhatsApp-Based Ordering)

At present, when a customer proceeds to purchase, they are redirected to WhatsApp for order confirmation and payment coordination.

This setup allows the brand to:
	•	Maintain direct communication with customers
	•	Offer personalized service
	•	Manage payments manually
	•	Reduce operational costs during early stages
	•	Handle logistics flexibly

This approach is practical for small-scale or emerging brands.

⸻

Future Payment Gateway Integration

Although payments are currently handled manually, the website is built to support future automation.

Planned upgrades include:
	•	Integration of Stripe or Razorpay payment gateway
	•	Secure online checkout flow
	•	Automated order confirmation
	•	Order management dashboard
	•	Basic shipping workflow automation
	•	Payment status tracking

Because the architecture is built using Next.js full-stack structure, these enhancements can be integrated without rebuilding the website.

Responsive Development

The website is fully responsive and optimized for:
	•	Desktop
	•	Tablet
	•	Mobile

Product grids, detail sections, and call-to-action buttons adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes. The mobile experience was prioritized to support traffic from social media and direct brand marketing.
