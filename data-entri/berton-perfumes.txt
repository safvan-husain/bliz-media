Industry: Fragrance & Perfume Retail
Project Type: Small-Scale eCommerce Website (Future-Ready Architecture)

Project Overview

Berton Perfumes is a boutique fragrance brand website developed for a growing small-scale perfume business. The objective of this project was to create a clean, elegant, and conversion-focused online presence that allows customers to explore products and initiate purchases easily.

Due to budget considerations and the brand’s early growth stage, the purchasing flow currently redirects customers to WhatsApp for order confirmation. However, the platform was architected to support full payment gateway integration in the future without structural changes.

This approach allowed the client to launch quickly while keeping the system scalable.

Tech Stack & Development Architecture

The website was developed using modern full-stack architecture with scalability in mind.

Technology Stack:
	•	Frontend: Next.js (React Framework)
	•	Backend: Next.js / Node.js architecture
	•	Rendering Strategy: Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for SEO optimization
	•	Styling: Component-based responsive design
	•	Hosting: Cloud-based optimized deployment

Using Next.js allows:
	•	SEO-friendly structure
	•	Fast page rendering
	•	Scalable routing system
	•	Clean and modular codebase
	•	Easy integration of future payment systems

The system was intentionally built to support seamless expansion into a complete automated eCommerce model when the business scales.

Current Purchase Flow (WhatsApp-Based Ordering)

At present, when customers select a product and proceed to purchase, they are redirected to WhatsApp for manual order confirmation.

This model was chosen because:
	•	It reduces operational costs for a small business
	•	It enables direct customer communication
	•	It allows flexible payment handling
	•	It simplifies logistics management
	•	It supports personalized customer service

This setup is ideal for early-stage or low-volume businesses.

Future Payment Gateway Integration

Although payment processing is currently handled manually, the website architecture is built to support full automation.

Planned future enhancements include:
	•	Integration of Stripe or Razorpay payment gateway
	•	Secure online checkout system
	•	Automated order confirmation
	•	Payment status tracking
	•	Order management dashboard
	•	Potential shipping automation

Because the system is built using Next.js full-stack architecture, payment gateway integration can be implemented without rebuilding the platform.

Responsive Development

The website is fully responsive and optimized for:
	•	Desktop
	•	Tablet
	•	Mobile

All components — including product listings, detail pages, and purchase buttons — adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes. Special attention was given to mobile layout since fragrance purchases often come from social media traffic.
