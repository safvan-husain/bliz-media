This project is a landing page for a digital marketing web development etc. agency. 

Always use Tailwind for styling, and make components into a components folder. 

Use colors from global load CSS instead of hardcoding in the UI component. 

When adding some data-related UI like testimonial or services providing, have data in a different section like a list of objects . Keep the UI separate from data so that I can later only modify data if needed. 

This project only has a single theme, so do not use dark mode.
